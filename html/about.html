        <p id="about">My name is Onur Valizada. 
        I was born in Baku, Azerbaijan in 2008.
        I completed nine years of study at School No. 107, 
        followed by two years of education at ADA School.
        Even though it was several years ago, one of my qualifications
        was enrolling in courses involving HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        I developed several websites at an amateur level during that time, but
        had to give up on web development for a while due to my education.
